i like solving problems by writing or configuring software! see my sites at https://rrv.sh and https://aenyrathia.wiki

projects:
- `git-livesync`: a vs code extension to automatically commit and sync with a git remote
- `hyprcloser`: a utility for hyprland to automatically close a window when it loses focus
- `aenyrathia`: a wiki for our ttrpg setting, backed by an axum server that reads from and writes to a git remote
- `tools`: a monorepo that provides my infra, config, and tools using a stack of nix, rust, tf, and gha

note: my contributions graph is stacked because i publish my writing [here](https://github.com/rrvsh/site-content), not because i am that crazed. also, 2025 is stacked because I used to commit directly to the main branch of my tools repo
